## Welcome 👋

I'm passionate about coding with [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/) especially for
- 💻 Simulations with [SciML](https://github.com/SciML) and
- 🎮 Control Systems with [ControlSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlSystems.jl)

My main projects are
- 🔥 [Hestia.jl](https://github.com/stephans3/Hestia.jl/) to simulate heat conduction in a cuboid
- 🤓 [BellBruno.jl](https://github.com/stephans3/BellBruno.jl/) to compute high-order derivatives of function compositions and
- ⚡ [Ellasy.jl](https://github.com/stephans3/Ellasy.jl/) to simulate Electrical Ladders in time-domain (...work in progress...)
